# Twitter_Sentimental_Analysis
The project is built to check the efficiency and compare the accuracy of <b>Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier</b> and <b>Logistic Regression Classification Algorithm</b> to perform 
<b>Sentimental Analysis</b> on the Tweets using the twitter dataset.
<br/>After running the classifiers on the dataset , we can observe that the number of false positives for Logistic Regression(75) is significantly lower than that of 
Multinomial NB(220) and however the number of true negatives of Multinomial NB(11659) is lower than Logistic Regression(11804).So, in conclusion Logistic Regression's accuracy was higher(95%) and is more reliable to use than Multinomial NB. Logistic Regression has performed better than Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier.
